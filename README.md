# AutoRec

A daemon for automatically recordings songs played on a digital piano connected via MIDI.

## Features

The main features of AutoRec are

- Automatic recording and separation of songs played on the device
- Web UI for browsing recordings chronologically and assigning titles
- Automatic suggestion of titles for new recordings based on the existing ones
- Playback of recordings back to the MIDI device

More features might be added at a later time on a by-need basis.

Some ideas are:
- Better organization of the web UI (e.g. browsing by title, pagination)
- Playing status tunes via MIDI (e.g. when the device was detected)

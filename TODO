Features:
    Management:
        ☐ Use SQLite database
        ☐ Store metadata (such as created timestamp, song name, rating)
        ☐ Browse recordings by different dimensions (not just a single list)
        ☐ Find a way to deal with a lot of recordings (loading everything into the webpage won't scale)
    
    Nice-to-haves:
        ☐ Auto-detect name based on matching with previous recordings

    Piano Interface:
        ☐ Add special "chord" for immediately starting new song (e.g. pressing two lowest keys)
        ☐ Play short tunes for notifications (e.g. "recording up and running" or "song finished")

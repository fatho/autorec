Goals:
    ✔ Monitor MIDI devices @done(22-05-21 13:41)
    Automatic recording:
        ✔ Start recorder when device is attached @started(22-05-21 13:41) @done(22-05-21 15:31) @lasted(1h50m16s)
        ☐ Keep track of ongoing recordings
        ✔ Make client matching configurable @done(22-05-22 13:43)
        ✔ Stop recorder when device is detached @done(22-05-22 13:43)
        ✔ Detect when new song starts @done(22-05-22 13:44)
        ☐ Write recorded events to MIDI file
    Web UI:
        ☐ View current state
        ☐ Live-update of view (maybe a SPA with websocket updates)
    Playback:
        ☐ Implement ALSA playback
        ☐ Play previously recorded MIDI files via Web-UI
    Convenience:
        ☐ Add proper config file format
        ☐ Add special "chord" for immediately starting new song (e.g. pressing two lowest keys)
        ☐ Play short tunes for notifications (e.g. "recording up and running" or "song finished")
